### Top 3 unexpected challenges encountered since last report

 * We had some bugs with a couple aspects of our backend / the lobby service that we couldn't figure out in time and had to work around.
     * The client communicates with the lobby service through requests to our backend graphql interface, it makes for simple requests but at times the testing of the endpoints was a bit confusing and wouldn't work the way we expected (we were able to figure out these issues for the most part).
     * The lobby service is returning session ids that are being converted to a Number and back to a string somewhere along the way, resulting in the last few digits being rounded down and the session id being incorrect.

### Top 3 lessons learned since last report

 * Start early and give yourself enough time to work through bugs. 
 * Receive help for bugs that we can't seem to figure out / can't seem to fix on our end.

### 3 most critical bugs in current functionality (optional)

 * The session id bug caused problems for a while until we figured out the issue, we were able to work around it by using the almost correct session id to locate the correct session id from the allSessions endpoint.
 * We were having trouble with our socket connections that alert clients of players joining a room, games starting, or boots moving. We couldn't figure out why it wasn't working and ended up having to work around by simulating a socket connection and checking for session updates manually by querying the LS every second or so. This method was unreliable and inconsistent as sometimes it just wouldn't work, due to possible request overloading or responses resolving at different times.
